# Single-Layer-Perceptron-Implementation-on-Handwritten-MNIST-dataS

This project implements a Single Layer Perceptron in recognising Handwritten Digit Images into Digits from (0-9). The Handwritten digit images are taken from the MNIST dataset . Two sets of image datasets are taken, the smaller one is reserved for testing and is used only after the model is built using the other dataset. The single layer perceptron model is built by taking a subset of the large training dataset. Then the Error is calculated by comparing the output  with the corresponding labels data. The models are built by not thresholding the input images once and by thresholding them the rest of the times. The model is built multiple times with 3 different  values of learning rates on two sets of training data . The percentage error in recognising each digit is found for all three models constructed with three 3 different  values of learning rates and it is plotted on bar charts. During the training process the Step function is used for activation and then later for one of the instances it  also uses the Sigmoid function .
